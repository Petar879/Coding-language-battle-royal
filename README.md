# The battle of the century

A personal playground for testing programming languages that I'm interested in. The reason is because I've switched to Linux(Pop_OS!) recently and .NET is not the most friendly with it. Also, It is also a great motivation to try out new languages.

*And what will make a language worthy of my attention?* <ins>The way that I feel about it, nothing else, I wont tell you of course.</ins>

# The task

All languages have to perform a simple task, load and image of an anime girl holding a programming book(curtsy to [cat-milk](https://github.com/cat-milk/Anime-Girls-Holding-Programming-Books) for creating this amazing repository and [Fuwn](https://github.com/senpy-club) for creating the amazing API that I will be using).
We have to write a console app that has to give you two options.

- Pressing '1', must load a random image, but in folder dedicated to the programming language.
- Pressing '2', must load a random image from the hole repository.

# The currently tested languages

- C#
- Python
- Go
- Rust

# The blacklist

- C/C++
- Java
- Kotlin
- Visual Basic

# Closing remarks

Feel free to open a new GitHub issue for calling me how bad I am at programming and also for suggesting new languages.
